This project presents a novel approach to door lock security by incorporating Morse code as a means of authentication. The Morse Code Door Lock System is an innovative solution that combines the principles of cryptography and electronics to provide a secure and unique way of accessing a locked door. The system uses a keypad interface to input Morse code sequences, which are then decoded and verified to grant or deny access to the door. The system's microcontroller-based architecture ensures fast and efficient processing of the Morse code inputs, while the encryption algorithm provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access. The proposed system offers a high level of security, ease of use, and flexibility, making it an attractive solution for various applications, including residential, commercial, and industrial settings. The project's objective is to design, develop, and test a functional prototype of the Morse Code Door Lock System, demonstrating its feasibility and potential for real-world implementation.This abstract provides a brief overview of your project, highlighting its main features, objectives, and benefits. It's concise, clear, and informative, making it suitable for a project report, conference paper, or research article.
